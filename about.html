            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="first">Hi there! I'm Rahul R, a passionate tech lover, rapper, songwriter, and a budding web developer. Right
                now, I'm pursuing my BCA at VIPS. After completing my 12th grade with computer science as my main
                subject, I dove into web development. I started with HTML and CSS, even managed to clone sites like
                NETFLIX.COM, and I'm currently diving into JavaScript. I truly enjoy creating and discovering new
                things, and I'm committed to giving my all to this journey because it brings me joy. </p>

        <div class="projectheading">PROJECTS</div>
        <DIV class="projectdetails">
            <p class="second">

                Upon acquiring knowledge in HTML and CSS, I felt compelled  to undertake a project, leading me to
                replicate NETFLIX.COM, a platform dedicated to streaming movies and web series. Through the completion
                of this project, I discovered numerous new concepts. While designing the  initial page, I noticed
                an issue with color correction and attempted to resolve  it using opacity, which proved ineffective.
                Eventually, I decided to overlay  a black div on the image, adjusted its opacity, and successfully
                achieved  the desired effect.
